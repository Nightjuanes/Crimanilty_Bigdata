# 🕵️ Chicago Crime Analysis – Big Data & Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of **20 years of crime data in the city of Chicago**, using **Big Data processing** techniques and **Machine Learning** to model and predict whether an individual is likely to be arrested based on a variety of factors.

Additionally, we developed an interactive **web dashboard** to explore the historical trends, insights, and patterns found in the data. Our analysis sheds light on the evolution of crime in Chicago and highlights social, temporal, and geographical dynamics over two decades.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Big Data Processing**: PySpark, Google Colab, Hadoop concepts  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Random Forest, Logistic Regression  
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Dash / Flask-based interface)  
- **Database**: CSV files (Chicago open data), Pandas, Spark DataFrames  
- **Deployment**: Localhost / GitHub Pages (if applicable)

## 🔍 Objectives

- Analyze and process a large-scale dataset of crime reports in Chicago (2001–2021)  
- Develop a **predictive model** to determine the likelihood of an **arrest** based on incident features  
- Create a **web dashboard** for interactive exploration of historical crime data  
- Discover patterns by **zone, season, time, and type of crime**

## 📊 Key Features

### ✅ Machine Learning Model
- Input: Crime type, location, date, time, domestic violence, season, zone, etc.
- Output: Probability of **arrest**
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC

### 🌐 Web Dashboard
- Dynamic graphs: Crimes by year, zone, time of day, and more  
- Filters: Type of crime, location, arrest status  
- Heatmaps & geographic insights (community areas, zones)  
- Downloadable visualizations & reports

### 📈 Insights Discovered
- Higher arrest rates in **domestic violence** cases and **central zones**  
- **Seasonal patterns**: Certain crimes peak in summer  
- **Temporal trends**: Crime intensity differs during working hours vs. night  
- Significant drop in arrests in recent years for some categories
